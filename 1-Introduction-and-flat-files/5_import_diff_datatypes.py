""" Importing different datatypes
The file seaslug.txt

has a text header, consisting of strings
is tab-delimited.
These data consists of percentage of sea slug larvae that had metamorphosed in a given time period. Read more here.

Due to the header, if you tried to import it as-is using np.loadtxt(), Python would throw you a ValueError and tell you that it could not convert string to float. There are two ways to deal with this: firstly, you can set the data type argument dtype equal to str (for string).

Alternatively, you can skip the first row as we have seen before, using the skiprows argument.

# Assign filename: file
file = 'seaslug.txt'

# Import file: data
data = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter='\t', dtype=str)

# Print the first element of data
print(data[0])

# Import data as floats and skip the first row: data_float
data_float = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter='\t', dtype=float, skiprows=1)

# Print the 10th element of data_float
print(data_float[9])

# Plot a scatterplot of the data
plt.scatter(data_float[:, 0], data_float[:, 1])
plt.xlabel('time (min.)')
plt.ylabel('percentage of larvae')
plt.show()
